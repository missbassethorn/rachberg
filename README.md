To run the tests look elsewhere we dont got any **YOLO**.

## Deploysment
To deploy to production, manually print out every line of code and mail it to Amazon and they will print it out into the webbernets using thier strange developer magic.

Alternatively, we might decide to setup a herokus or something

## Conclusion
In summary, most of our code is boilerplate stuff that was generated by rails because rails. We learned the value of friendship and of zsh autocomplete. Be kind to one and other, and remember to be kind to your mothers. Nothing is more baddass than respecting others.
